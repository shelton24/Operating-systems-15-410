The first time you'll see gajillions of messages about
missing files, because when you start out you're missing
gajillions of files.  That's ok.  Once you've fetched
those files you can try "make".  You'll need to have
the 410 bin/ directory on your PATH to find the tool-chain
wrappers (410-gcc, 410-ld, etc.).

Please be careful when adding things to config.mk that you
put everything in the right place--if some .o files are
listed in the wrong place your game might build for you but
either the game or the console tester won't build for us.

As you implement each part of the driver library, delete
the corresponding part of kern/fake.c.  Eventually delete
the file.  At each step, modify your config.mk appropriately.
